## 📖 1. Language Introduction

Solidity is a high-level programming language for implementing smart contracts. It is an object-oriented, statically typed language that has been influenced by C++, Python and JavaScript. It was originally developed by Gavin Wood in 2014 and is now used to develop smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. Solidity runs on the EVM. Solidity is compiled into bytecode and then executed on the EVM. It is designed to support smart contracts on the Ethereum platform. Currently, Solidity is still one of the most popular smart contract programming languages!

## ✨ 2. Features

- 🌈 Smart contract programming: Solidity is a programming language designed specifically for writing smart contracts, providing a set of special features and syntax to support contract programming
- 🔗 Object-oriented programming: Solidity supports object-oriented programming, which can define contracts (classes), inheritance, interfaces, etc. This makes Solidity code highly scalable and reusable
- 📦 Static type: Solidity is a statically typed programming language, which means that type errors can be detected at compile time, reducing the possibility of runtime errors
- 🔍 Advanced language features: Solidity has some advanced language features, such as user-defined types, function modifiers, events, etc., which makes Solidity better at handling complex business logic
- 🌍 Rich ecology: Solidity is used as the development language of Ethereum smart contracts, and has rich development documents, tutorials and community support. This greatly reduces the difficulty of learning and using
